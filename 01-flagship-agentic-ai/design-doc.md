## 🔍 Project: Agentic AI Assistant

## 📌 Objective
Build a modular AI agent that can receive tasks, plan steps, and execute them using tools.

## ⚙️ Architecture
- **Agent Core:** Manages goals, memory, and decision-making.
- **Tools Interface:** Connects to APIs (e.g., calendar, browser).
- **LLM Backend:** OpenAI GPT-4 or similar for reasoning.

## 🧱 Tech Stack
- Python
- LangChain / AutoGPT
- FastAPI for interface
- Redis for short-term memory
- GitHub Actions for automation

## 📅 Timeline
| Phase         | Task                         | Duration    |
|---------------|------------------------------|-------------|
| Planning      | Problem + feature definition | 2 days      |
| Research      | Review tools / lang options  | 3 days      |
| Prototyping   | Build MVP agent              | 1 week      |
| Testing       | Task simulations             | 4 days      |
| Final Launch  | Package and deploy           | 3 days      |

## 🧠 Reasoning Behind Decisions
I chose modular design to allow multiple agents and tools in future updates.

## 🧪 Risks & Mitigations
- 🔥 Memory overload: Use Redis and time-based memory limits
- ❌ Tool failure: Add retry logic + logging

## 📈 Future Improvements
- Integrate with email
- Add voice input
- Deploy on mobile
