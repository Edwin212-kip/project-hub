# Meditech Delivery System â€“ Pain Points

## 1. Long Waiting Times
Patients often wait hours to see doctors due to poor scheduling and a lack of real-time queue management.

## 2. Poor Record Keeping
Hospitals rely on physical files or outdated software, causing loss or delay in retrieving patient history.

## 3. Medication Errors
Manual prescription systems lead to misinterpretation, wrong dosages, or unavailable drugs.

## 4. Inefficient Billing
Billing errors, delays in insurance processing, and lack of transparency frustrate patients and delay discharge.

## 5. Staff Overload
Doctors and nurses are overwhelmed due to lack of automation in routine administrative tasks.

## 6. Fragmented Communication
Lab results, pharmacy, radiology, and ward staff often operate in silos, delaying coordinated care.

## 7. No Feedback Loop
There's no structured way for patients to provide feedback, making service improvement difficult.
